## Overview
This project involved the design and implementation of a full-stack web-application integrated with a relational database to manage airline seat reservations on behalf of "B Airways", a fictional subsidiary of Virgin Airlines. 

## Functionality
The airline reservation system includes a user interface for booking flights, an admin panel for data analytics as well as report generation features with identity and access management. It has three tiers of users, with varying discount prices for each upon repeat bookings. 
Users were able to search for flights using their intended departure and arrival airports as well as the date and select from the flights available.
In addition, the system featured an admin dashboard which allowed various analytics capabilities to assist in decision-making and management.

## Database Design
The database design is at the core of the project, following best practices to ensure data integrity, consistency, and performance. We used stored procedures, database triggers, and various other techniques to construct an optimized and normalized database for our application.
